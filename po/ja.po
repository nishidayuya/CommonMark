"Markdown is a plain text format for writing structured documents, based on "
"conventions used for indicating formatting in email and usenet posts.  It "
"was developed in 2004 by John Gruber, who wrote the first Markdown-to-HTML "
"converter in perl, and it soon became widely used in websites.  By 2014 "
"there were dozens of implementations in many languages.  Some of them "
"extended basic Markdown syntax with conventions for footnotes, definition "
"lists, tables, and other constructs, and some allowed output not just in "
"HTML but in LaTeX and many other formats."
msgstr "Markdownは構造化された文書を書くための普通のテキストフォーマットで，電子メールやUSENETの投稿で書式を示すために使われた規則を元にしています．"
"Perlで最初のMarkdownからHTMLへのコンバータを書いたJohn Gruberによって2004年に開発され，すぐに様々なウェブサイトで使われるようになりました．"
"2014年には多くの言語でたくさんの実装ができました．"
"それらの内いくつかは脚注や定義リスト，表，その他の構成物のための規則のためにMarkdownの文法を拡張し，いくつかはHTMLではなくLaTeXやその他の多くのフォーマットの出力を可能にしました．"

"(Note: `Markdown.pl` did allow double quotes inside a double-quoted title, "

"see a good rationale for the extra complexity this brings, since there are "
"already many ways---backslash escaping, entities, or using a different quote "
"type for the enclosing title---to write titles containing double quotes.  "
"`Markdown.pl`'s handling of titles has a number of other strange features.  "
"For example, it allows single-quoted titles in inline links, but not "
"reference links.  And, in reference links but not inline links, it allows a "
"title to begin with `\"` and end with `)`.  `Markdown.pl` 1.0.1 even allows "
"titles with no closing quotation mark, though 1.0.2b8 does not.  It seems "
"preferable to adopt a simple, rational rule that works the same way in "
